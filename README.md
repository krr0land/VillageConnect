# About Village Connect

The goal of Village Connect is quite straightforward: connect all houses in the village with each other, so that all houses are reachable from any other house. To do this you can build roads. Try to use the least amount of roads possible.

The game was inspired by Mini Metro.

## Controls

- Left Mouse Button - Build road
- Right Mouse Button - Remove road
- WASD, Arrows - Move camera
- Left Shift - Faster movement
- Mouse Wheel - Zoom in/out

# Future plans

The current version of Village Connect is just an early prototype.

Planned features include:

- Gradually expanding level: in the beginning, only a small area is available, but as the player progresses, more and more houses will be added
- Limited number of roads: the player will have a limited number of roads to build, so they have to plan carefully
- More detailed world: for example the addition of rivers, dense forests, etc. as well as more verticality
- More complex road types: for example bridges, tunnels, etc.
- A tool to destroy obstacles
- Mobile and Controller support
- Other improvements
